These are some of the scripts I used to conduct my virus discovery studies. 

Trimmomatic was used for quality and length filtering and STAR for alignment of sequences and collection of unmapped reads. The sequences I worked with were single end Illumina RNA seq reads.

I added references at the end for those who want to learn more about Trimmomatic or STAR. 

If you want to learn more, here is a link to my published article talking about my studies of the wheat virome:
